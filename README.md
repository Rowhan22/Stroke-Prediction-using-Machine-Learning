# Stroke-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of stroke occurrence using machine learning models trained on health and demographic data. The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model training to achieve reliable predictions. The final model can be used for early stroke prediction and risk assessment.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information on:

Features:

age: Age of the patient.

hypertension: Whether the patient has hypertension (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

heart_disease: Whether the patient has heart disease (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

avg_glucose_level: Average glucose level in the blood.

bmi: Body Mass Index.

Additional categorical features like gender, ever_married, work_type, Residence_type, and smoking_status.

Target:

stroke: Whether the patient experienced a stroke (1 = Stroke, 0 = No Stroke).
